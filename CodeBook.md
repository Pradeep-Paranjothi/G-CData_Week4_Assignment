#Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations carried out to clean up the data 

##Key Fields/Data Identifiers:
subjectID - - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
activityId - An identifier of the type of activity performed when the observations were recorded
activityType - Type of the activity being performed, please see below for description
